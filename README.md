# üìùGitCMS, a new way to manage sites hosted on GitHub.
Welcome to GitCMS, a Git-based, JAMstack-compatible CMS that allows you to easily, simply, and efficently manage the content of your site for free. 

# ‚ùìWhat is this?
This is supposed to be a very basic CMS, mainly just to allow you to edit and view Markdown files easily, quickly, and efficently. It also includes a code editor and defaults to a nice text editor on unsupported files. It also supports viewing of videos, audio, and images. It's super fast, both to deploy (you can deploy this site in under 10 seconds with Cloudflare Pages, including building of the Functions and setup) & to use. It has no dependencies and only relies on the GitHub API to allow you to edit & view files. It's overanimated, meaning if you love eye candy, you'll love using this. It has a nice UI, and scales all the way from a phone to a large desktop. This project's goal is to make editing your site easier by providing a great Markdown editor with the ease-of-use of just clicking a few intuitive buttons!

# How can I set this up?
This repository includes the files necessary for a custom, self-hosted authentication setup. For this to work, I've used Cloudflare Functions to handle the authentication. You can convert the Workers code to any backend language you want, but for this example, we'll be using Cloudflare Pages. 

First, clone this repository and setup the site on Cloudflare by naming it whatever you'd like. Connect Cloudflare Pages with your GitHub account and then add the cloned repository. Next, try building the site (it may fail, but that's OK) and then following these instructions:

In the `Settings` tab, click `Builds & deployments` and enter the following information:
    - Change the 'Build Command' to `rm README.md LICENSE` (to remove unnecessary files before deployment)
    - Configure the 'Build system version' to use version `2`

Now, we need to get the authentication script working. For additional security, it's recommended that you host your own auth script, so lets set that up. First, go to the [GitHub Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click `OAuth Apps`. Create a new app and name it whatever you'd like. Set the Homepage URL to your Cloudflare Pages URL (ends in *.pages.dev). Set the Authorization Callback URL to your Cloudflare Pages default URL, but add /callback to it. For example, if your URL is gitcms.pages.dev, set the Callback URL to 'https://gitcms.pages.dev/callback' **It is very important that you set the Authorization Callback URL correctly.** Now, copy the Client ID variable and create a new client secret. **It is extremely important that you use this client secret carefully.** Don't share it with ANYBODY, and ONLY paste it in the environment variable with it encrypted. You should never see this secret again for security reasons. Now, you're ready to start to start setting up the variables.
In the `Environment Variables` tab, enter these variables in the Production environment:
    - Set the `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` variable to your copied Client ID from GitHub. 
    - Set the `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` variable to your copied Client Secret that you recieved from GitHub. **Encrypt this variable.**
    - Set the `REDIRECT_URL` to the exact same URL as the 'Authorization callback URL' you set in GitHub.

Now, head back to 'Deployments' and rebuild based off the last build. If you are having problems with the authentication scripts, change the 'Compatibility Date' within the 'Functions' tab to `2023-03-14`. You should only do this if are encountering issues. Otherwise, leave it to the latest version for better security.
